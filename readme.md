## Installation

Use [NPM](https://www.npm.js) to install Theme Envy.

```bash
npm install @softlimit/theme-envy --save-dev
```

## Getting Started
You can get started one of three ways:
* With an empty directory structure
* By importing an existing theme from Github or a local directory
* By running `npx theme-envy init` in an existing Shopify theme directory

To get started with an existing theme, we can use Shopify's [Dawn](https://github.com/Shopify/dawn) as an example, but you can also specify a local path.
```bash
# Imports Dawn, and with the --convert flag: 
# Adds Theme Envy directories
# Adds Theme Envy install hooks to layout/theme.liquid
# Parses existing sections and creates Theme Envy "features" when possible
npx theme-envy init https://github.com/Shopify/dawn.git --convert
```
Edit the new `theme.config.js` in your project root with your store's myshopify domain
```javascript
module.exports = {
  ...
  store: 'your-shop.myshopify.com',
  ...
}
```

> During the `init` command a new "Feature" is added to your project called `theme-envy` in `src/_features/theme-envy`. This feature will add a snippet and `{% render 'theme-envy' %}` to the end of your `<head>` tag in `layout/theme.liquid` during project build. This handles all the Theme Envy JS and CSS.

You are now ready to start developing! Get started with this simple command in your terminal
```bash
npx theme-envy dev
```

## Theme Directory Structure
Theme Envy directories are prefixed with `_`.
The other directories are the [Shopify standard directories](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/architecture#directory-structure-and-component-types).
```bash
.
|-- _elements # for Custom Elements/Web Components
|-- _features # individual directories of discrete features
|-- _partials # small .liquid files that are reusable/inserted across the theme
|-- _schema # .js files for sharing bits of section/config schema across the theme
|-- assets
|-- config
|-- layout
|-- locales
|-- sections
|-- snippets
`-- templates
  `--customers
```

## Build Tools

### Elements
Theme Envy is optimized for using [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components). You can initialize a new Web Component using `utils/starter-element.js` in your project with this command in your terminal:
```bash
npx theme-envy new element <your-element>
```
Your **element** file must have the same name as your new CustomElement (Web Component). Theme Envy will only load the asset(s) for `your-element` if element is present in the DOM.

> To take advantage of Theme Envy's smart loading of **elements** they must be inside the `_elements` directory

You can also setup an **element** as a subdirectory of `_elements` by using an index.js file (`_elements/your-element/index.js`). In this case your subdirectory must have the same name as your Web Component.

### Features
Theme Envy "Features" are bigger pieces/sections of your site. Any JS/CSS assets associated with a feature will be loaded as part of the main `theme-envy.js` file on all templates in your theme.

> Features are subdirectories of `src/_features`.
  
```bash
.
|-- config # .js files concatenated and added to settings_schema.json
|-- partials # .liquid files that are referenced using Theme Envy {% partial 'file-name' %} tag
|-- schema # .js files with module.exports to be injected into section files, or referenced with ThemeRequire()
|-- scripts # .js files to be imported into index.js
|-- sections # .liquid files only, included in build automatically
|-- snippets # .liquid files only, included in build automatically
|-- styles # contains any .css files, must be imported into index.js
|- index.js # is concatenated and loaded sitewide
`- install.js # defines where to inject code into hooks
```

### Hooks/installs
Hooks are places in our theme code where *Features* and *Elements* can insert code during build. This allows us to keep integrations discrete and easily undoable. To define a hook in the theme, we only need to add a `hook` tag like so:
```javascript
{% hook 'head-end' %}
```
We can then reference this spot in our theme code with an install.js file in a feature or element.
```javascript
module.exports = [
  {
    hook: 'head-end',
    content: "{% render 'custom-snippet' %}",
    priority: 0-100 // optional, 50 is default
  }
]
```
During the build, all code for the `head-end` hook will be collected, sorted by priority (where 0 is highest in the code), and will replace the `{% hook 'head-end' %}` tag.

### Schema/Theme Require
We were frustrated by how difficult it is to share smaller pieces of Shopify Section schema across sections. Theme Envy includes a couple of tools to make this easier.
#### JS Section Schema
Use this syntax in section `.liquid` files in place of the normal `{% schema %}{% endschema %}` tags:
```javascript
{% schema 'schema-your-section.js' %}
```
> Don't worry about relative/absolute paths here, Theme Envy will find your uniquely named schema js file within your project.

When managing your section as a **Feature** we recommend putting all of your schema files in that feature's `schema` subdirectory. Schema that is shared across multiple features/sections should go in `src/_schema`
> All **schema** files must be within a `schema` or `_schema` directory

### Partials
By using the syntax 
```javascript 
{% partial '_file-name' %}
```
the contents of the liquid file named `_file-name.liquid` are inserted directly into the output file. Our practice is to name these files with a leading _, but it is not required.
> All **partial** files must be within a `partials` or `_partials` directory

### Theme
We can use this markup to access properties of our `theme.config.js` file within liquid files. This is especially helpful for when you have to access a breakpoint value within your markup.
```javascript
{% theme 'breakpoints.md' %} // defined in theme.config.js
```

## Theme.config.js
After initializing your Theme Envy project, you will find a `theme.config.js` file in your project root. This is where we manage all of our Theme Envy build options.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  entry: {
    // Add entrypoints (Webpack) here
    // main: './src/scripts/main.js',
  },
  store: 'sl-dev-testing.myshopify.com',
  themePath: 'src', // directory for theme source files
  outputPath: 'dist', // directory for build output
  // tailwind: true, // set to false to disable Tailwind
  breakpoints: {
    sm: '640px',
    // => @media (min-width: 640px) { ... }

    md: '768px',
    // => @media (min-width: 768px) { ... }

    lg: '1024px',
    // => @media (min-width: 1024px) { ... }

    xl: '1280px',
    // => @media (min-width: 1280px) { ... }

    '2xl': '1536px'
  // => @media (min-width: 1536px) { ... }
  }
}
```
